# Smart-Light-Intersection
This project is an Artificial Intelligence project where an intersection trains through reinforcement learning. The SMART 4 way intersection learns which lights to turn green and red depending on whether there are more cars and less cars at each light. 
The project was created using c++ and object oriented programming.
